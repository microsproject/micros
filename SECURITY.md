# MicrOS Security Policy

## Supported Versions

MicrOS is under active development. Security patches are applied to the following branches:

* **main** – actively developed, security updates applied.
* **latest release tag** – supported for critical security fixes.

Older, unmaintained versions may not receive fixes. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest stable release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in MicrOS or its related projects:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue.
2. **Do** contact the dev team via contact form at **[MicrOS project - Contact us](https://microsproject.dev/#contact)**.
3. Include as much detail as possible:

   * Steps to reproduce
   * Affected versions/commits
   * Potential impact
   * Suggested fixes or mitigations (if known)

We will acknowledge your report within **72 hours** and provide an initial assessment.

## Handling Process

* We investigate the report and confirm the vulnerability.
* We work on a fix in a private branch.
* Once a patch is ready, we prepare a coordinated release.
* Security advisories will be published in this repository and via release notes.

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you:

* **Avoid disclosing** the issue publicly until we have released a fix.
* **Test only against your own systems** – do not exploit vulnerabilities in MicrOS deployments without explicit permission.
* Give us a reasonable time window (usually **90 days**) to address the issue before public disclosure.

## Acknowledgments

We value the community’s help in keeping MicrOS safe and reliable. Security researchers who responsibly report vulnerabilities may be credited in release notes, unless anonymity is requested.
